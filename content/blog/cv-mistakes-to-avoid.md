Your CV is often your first impression with a potential employer. Don't let these common mistakes hold you back.

## 1. Spelling and Grammar Errors

Nothing screams unprofessional like typos. Proofread multiple times and have someone else review your CV before sending it out.

## 2. Using a Generic Template

Your CV should reflect your personal brand. While templates can be helpful, customize them to stand out and showcase your unique value.

## 3. Including Irrelevant Information

Focus on experiences and skills relevant to the job you're applying for. Your summer job 15 years ago probably doesn't need to be there.

## 4. Poor Formatting

A cluttered, hard-to-read CV will likely be tossed aside. Use:
- Clear section headers
- Consistent formatting
- Adequate white space
- Professional fonts (10-12pt)
- Bullet points for easy scanning

## 5. Lack of Quantifiable Achievements

Instead of "Managed social media accounts," say "Grew Instagram following by 150% in 6 months, resulting in 40% increase in website traffic."

## 6. Listing Responsibilities Instead of Achievements

Employers know what a project manager does. They want to know what YOU accomplished in that role and the impact you made.

## 7. Making It Too Long

Unless you're very senior with extensive relevant experience, keep your CV to 2 pages maximum. For most professionals, one page is ideal.

## 8. Including Personal Information

In most countries, you don't need to include:
- Photo (unless specifically requested)
- Age or date of birth
- Marital status
- Religion or political affiliation

## 9. Using Passive Language

Strong action verbs make a bigger impact:
- Led, developed, created, implemented, achieved
- NOT: Responsible for, duties included, helped with

## 10. Not Tailoring for Each Application

Customize your CV for each position. Highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to that specific job posting.

## Bonus Tips

- Use a professional email address
- Include links to your portfolio or LinkedIn
- Keep it honest—never lie or exaggerate
- Save and send as a PDF to preserve formatting
- Name your file professionally: "FirstName_LastName_CV.pdf"

## The Bottom Line

Your CV is a marketing document. Every word should demonstrate why you're the best candidate for the job. Take the time to craft it carefully, and you'll see better results from your applications.

Remember: A great CV doesn't just list what you've done—it tells the story of your professional journey and makes employers excited to meet you.
